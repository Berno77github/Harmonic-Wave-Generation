# Harmonic-Wave-Generation
This repository showcases a MATLAB project that generates and visualizes harmonic waves by summing multiple sinusoidal functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. The project helps illustrate the concept of harmonic synthesis and how complex waveforms are formed from simpler sine waves.

Project: Harmonic Wave Generation
This project will generate and visualize a complex waveform created by summing multiple sine waves at different frequencies and amplitudes.

Explanation:
 1) Parameters: You can modify the fs, T, frequencies, and amplitudes arrays to create different harmonic combinations.
 2) Wave Generation: The code sums the individual sine waves to form a complex waveform.
 3) Plotting: It plots both the individual harmonic waves and the resulting combined waveform.
