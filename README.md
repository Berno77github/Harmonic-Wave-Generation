# Harmonic-Wave-Generation
This repository showcases a MATLAB project that generates and visualizes harmonic waves by summing multiple sinusoidal functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. The project helps illustrate the concept of harmonic synthesis and how complex waveforms are formed from simpler sine waves.
